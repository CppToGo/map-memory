# 地图记忆(Map Memory)
I've always had trouble taking notes, because there are too many categories, there are dozens of solutions out there, but this one is special, it correlates geo location with notebook, which I think is quite interesting,and helps memorize things a lot. Personally I use it to take notes, write travel diary and memorize many other things.
